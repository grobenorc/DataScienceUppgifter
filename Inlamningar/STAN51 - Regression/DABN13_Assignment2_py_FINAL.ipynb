    "Technically, we could use the `statsmodels` package to learn a logistic regressions. However, the functionality of `statsmodels` addresses applications in classical statistics rather than machine learning. Since we want to use logistic regression as a supervised learning algorithm in order to predict the output of new data points, it is much wiser to switch to scikit-learn (`sklearn`). `sklearn` provides you with simple functions that implement model training, tuning and validation and therefore covers the entire spectrum of standard methods in supervised learning.\n",

    "3. Instantiate a logistic regression model using the `LogisticRegression()` function from the `linear_model` module and save this model specification as `glm_spec_1b`. The function has an argument `penalty`. Set this argument to `None`. Furthermore ensure that an intercept is automatically added to the input variables.\n",
